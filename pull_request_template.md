My reflections on how this week's project turned out: I found very challenging to use redux-toolkit to create slices, reducers and actions by myself

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail: I created priority levels for the todos and it works fine to put a priority level when creating a new todo but I didn't manage to change the priority of an existing todo.
